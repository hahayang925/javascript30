        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one way
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };
        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        // captain.number = 99;
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
        console.log(cap2);
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = {...players};
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

            name: 'wes',
            age: 100,
